# Navigation Matrix
### Audio Interface for Elite Dangerous
### Forked from SingularTier's A.E.R. Interface.


Navigation Matrix is licensed under LGPL 3.0

### Instructions

This fork's main intention is to increase user-friendliness when used as a plugin with Voice Attack.

This project is in it's infancy.

My Goals are.
1. better responses
2. more configurable
3. always-ready. (no more "Hey Aer")
