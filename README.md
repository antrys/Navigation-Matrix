This fork's main intention is to increase user-friendliness when used as a plugin with Voice Attack.
As-such, console mode support is being abbandoned in this fork.  The console is still there, but I'm mainly just using it for debugging purposes.  
You can try and use the console, if you wish.  But understand, I'm focused on this being a Voice Attack Plugin.

This project is in it's infancy.
Please note:  I don't really consider myself a "programmer." it's more of a hobby for me.
In fact I haven't coded a single line for about 20 years, and that was quickbasic on DOS!
So, I guess I'm saying, don't expect me to know all the latest coding conventions, standards, and practices.  I'm learning.
That being said, I'm a pretty quick study.  If you'd like a new feature, I can try, but no promises.  It could be a bigger bite than I can chew with my current skillset.
